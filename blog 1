        <h1>AI and Cybersecurity: The Future of Digital Protection</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a crucial tool in cybersecurity. AI enhances threat detection, automates responses, and strengthens defenses against cyberattacks. In this blog, we explore how AI is revolutionizing cybersecurity and its potential impact on digital security.</p>
        
        <h2>AI in Threat Detection</h2>
        <p>AI-powered systems analyze vast amounts of data to detect anomalies and potential threats. Unlike traditional cybersecurity measures, AI continuously learns from new threats, improving its ability to identify suspicious activities.</p>
